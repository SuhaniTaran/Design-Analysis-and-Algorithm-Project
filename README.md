Design Analysis and Algorithm Project using prim's algorithm to find the isolated areas
<br><br>
Analysis and Algorithm Project focuses on identifying isolated areas affected by disasters using Prim's algorithm. By analyzing disaster data such as earthquakes and floods, the project constructs a graph of affected locations and calculates the minimum spanning tree to highlight critical connections. The results are visualized on an interactive map created with Folium, showing both the isolated and connected regions. This visualization aids in understanding the geographic distribution of affected areas, helping in effective disaster management and response planning.
